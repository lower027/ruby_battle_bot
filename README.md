# ruby_battle_bot

This is a vanilla Ruby version of a battle bot for my friend's characters. 

The character_datasheet.csv will need to be downloaded along with the main bot (wishwing_battlebot.rb) for the bot to function.

My friend requested that I implement type matchups, critical hit chances, and various stats like in Pokemon.
